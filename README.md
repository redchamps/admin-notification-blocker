It will allow you to block admin notification based on Severities/Categories. For example, you can disallow all the notifications expect
the critical ones.

You might have seen lot of notifications like these

![Notice Type Notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redchamps/repo-images/master/admin-notification-blocker/admin-notice-type-notifications.png)

These can be irritating most of the times as they consist of promotional & survey content. So, we came up with this extension.
It will block **Notice** type notifications by default but you can choose the type you want to block from below admin setting

`Store > Configuration > RedChamps > Admin Notification Blocker > Blocked Severities`
